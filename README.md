# TFM
## Development of Mechanisms for Application Handover in Edge Computing Environments using Software-Defined Networks

This is the GitHub repository for my Master final project. 

**REQUIRED SETUP**

To run this project correctly, please, follow the instructions to install and configure the environment:
- [VNX lab Virtual Machine](https://github.com/luis-casarrubios-elez/TFM/tree/master/environment/VNX)
- [ONOS Controller](https://github.com/luis-casarrubios-elez/TFM/tree/master/environment/ONOS)
- [ONOS App](https://github.com/luis-casarrubios-elez/TFM/tree/master/environment/App)

**START/STOP SCENARIO**

To start the scenario, in the VNX lab Virtual Machine, just run the command:

$`sudo vnx -f TFM-FINAL -t`

This will bring the virtual infrastructure up. To check that the scenario has connectivity:

$`sudo vnx -f TFM-FINAL --execute pingall`

I recommend to execute this command to see the complete network diagram:

$`sudo vnx -f TFM-FINAL -v --show-map`

Now, to install and configure Apache Traffic Server on the Proxy host:

$`sudo vnx -f TFM-FINAL --execute ats`

If you run into any DNS resolution problem, just bring the scenario down with the following command and start over:

$`sudo vnx -f TFM-FINAL -P`

**TRY THE APP**

To test the ONOS app that I coded, access the Karaf console (ONOS CLI):

$`onos localhost`

And there, be sure that Reactive Forwarding app is activated:

\>`app activate fwd`

Also, check that the new app is activated too:

\>`app activate foo.app`

Last, logout the Karaf console and load the scenario config to the controller with:

\>`logout`

$`onos-netcfg localhost ~/onos/foo-app/app-config.json`

From this moment on, all the http traffic coming from the clients will be redirected to the Proxy server automatically.
